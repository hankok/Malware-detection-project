In this project, we implemented a real-time detection monitor capable of detect- ing suspicious behaviors in signature, file system, processes, registry and network activities by integrally analyzing outputs from various monitor sources. The mon- itors we employed include but not limited to NtTrace, Netmon, Tshark, Deviare, and sigcheck.
Our system can run upon per malware or attach to already running processes. Experimental results on both toy malware and real malware show the effectiveness and early report of our monitor. For effective detection, our monitor can report highly suspicious executable within 200ms after it runs. A full MiT tree and suspi- cious behavior table will be printed to standard output. While our engine still has some false positive in code injection, the overall FPR is near zero.
For future improvement, we seek to integrate all functionality into one monitors rather than coordinate among multiple logs provided by different monitors. We also plan to extend our framework to system-wide scope which requires kernel land deployment.
